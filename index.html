            <h2>FIRST in our community</h2>
            <p>Placeholder text: We're a student-led team that gives everyone opportunities to learn mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, as well as business, communication, and teamwork skills. We believe that <i>FIRST</i> is a life-changing experience that everyone should be able to have, so we spread STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) within our community through events and outreach initiatives.</p>
