## Women in STEM
Our Women in STEM event allows girls grades 7 to 12 to interact and connect with female engineers and engineering students from around the area. Through hands-on, fun workshops, girls can see just how fun STEM can be. The event is free to registrants and lunch is generously provided by UMass Lowell. We have had 6 events so far from our first event in 2016 with 12 girls and our last one in 2018 with 50 girls in attendance. 

At the event the students do activities learning mechanical, electrical, software and leadership skills. Activities range from candy dispensers, wooden catapults, altoid tin flashlights and learning how to design a website. We have a q&a panel during the events for the attendees to interact and connect with female engineers.

We host the event at UMass Lowell in there makerspace, which is 102 Falmouth Hall.

## First Lego League and First Lego League Jr.
With the help of our parent organization Merrimack Valley Robotics and our local elementary schools we have 24 FLL Jr. teams and recently started 2 FLL Teams. We host a 2 expos each year at Lowell High school to celebrates the students work. 

During the expo there are many activities for the students to do besides presenting to the judges. We have station we the students can drive our robot, Lego free build, face painting and build marshmallow bridges.

We plan on growing both of out FLL and FLL Jr. programs to all of our local elementary and middle schools in the upcoming year.

## English Language Learners in STEM
Weâ€™ve noticed that it can be challenging for local immigrant and refugee students to access engineering electives and activities while adjusting to a new country, language, and lifestyle. We have held an after-school event for those students, helping them assemble and solder parts to make an Altoid tin flashlight.

## Cub Scouts
We worked with our local Cub Scouts Den to help them earn there robot achievement badge. We talked to them about FIRST and helped them make a robot using the We Do 2.0 Kits. With the kits we provided we taught them about how robots are used in the workplace and with our help they made a robot hand.

## Lowell Spinners
Each summer we host a STEM night at a Lowell Spinners Baseball game. During this event we introduce passerby's to our robots and what FIRST is and the several programs we offer locally. We let kids drive our robot and have several raffle. In the past years our robot has thrown the first pitch at the Lowell Spinners baseball game. We have worked with other FRC teams to spread FIRST at this event.

## Dracut Old Home Day
Each year in September we have a booth at Dracut Old Home day to spread FRC to the students who attend there from other sports clubs. We also let kids drive our robot and introduce them to our younger programs, FLL and FLL jr. Also we raffle over 10 raffle basket at this event.
