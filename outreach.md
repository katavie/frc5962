## Women in STEM
Our Women in STEM event allows girls grades 7 to 12 to interact and connect with female engineers and engineering students from around the area. Through hands-on, fun workshops, girls can see just how fun STEM can be. The event is free to registrants and lunch is generously provided by UMass Lowell. We have had 6 events so far from our first event in 2016 with 12 girls and our last one in 2018 with 50 girls in attendance. 

At the event the students do activities learning mechanical, electrical, software and leadership skills. Activities range from candy dispensers, wooden catapults, altoid tin flashlights and learning how to design a website. We have a q&a panel during the events for the attendees to interact and connect with female engineers.

We host the event at UMass Lowell in there makerspace, which is 102 Falmouth Hall.

## FLL and FLL Jr.
With the help of our parent organization Merrimack Valley Robotics and our local elementary schools we have 24 FLL Jr. teams and recently started 2 FLL Teams. We host a 2 expos each year at Lowell High school to celebrates the students work. 

During the expo there are many activities for the students to do besides presenting to the judges. We have station we the students can drive our robot, Lego free build, face painting and build marshmallow bridges.

We plan on growing both of out FLL and FLL Jr. programs to all of our local elementary and middle schools in the upcoming year.
