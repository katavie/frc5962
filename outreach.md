## Women in STEM
Our Women in STEM event allows girls grades 7 to 12 to interact and connect with female engineers and engineering students from around the area. Through hands-on, fun workshops, girls can see just how fun STEM can be. The event is free to registrants and lunch is generously provided by UMass Lowell. We have had 6 events so far from our first event in 2016 with 12 girls and our last one in 2018 with 50 girls in attendance. We host the event at UMass Lowell in there makerspace, which is 102 Falmouth Hall.

## FLL and FLL Jr.
With the help of our parent organization Merrimack Valley Robotics and our local elementary schools we have 24 FLL Jr. teams and recently strated 2 FLL Teams
