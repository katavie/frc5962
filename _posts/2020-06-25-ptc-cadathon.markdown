Our mechanical design team participated in a CADathon hosted by PTC and Onshape. We worked with FRC 319, Big Bad Bob and FRC 8046, the LakerBots to design a alliance of robots that could grocery shop during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Over 150 teams participated, our alliance won the amazing alliance award for the best alliance and our robot placed 7th overall. This was a great learning experience for our team members.
